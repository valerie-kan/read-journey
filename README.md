Read Journey is a web application that allows registered users to add books from a list of recommended ones or add their books and track their reading progress over time. Users can filter recommended books, manage their personal library, remove books and delete reading progress as needed.

The application includes public pages such as Login and Registration, and protected/private pages such as the Home Page, Library and My Reading Page, which are accessible only to authenticated users.
